    <h1> Turkish Chickpea Bowls</h1>
    <img src="../img/turk.avif" height="500" width="650" alt="Turkish Chickpea Bowl">
    <p>A chickpea bowl is the epitome of plant-based perfection. In this one, Turkish
        spiced chickpeas are roasted alongside onion wedges and grape tomatoes, then 
        tossed with bright and tangy lemon zest. Veggies are served over a bed of 
        fragrant basmati rice mixed with pistachios and golden raisins for 
        texture and sweetness, And since the secret's always in the sauce, you'll finish
        things off with a drizzle of herby lemon hummus that brings all these flavors together.
