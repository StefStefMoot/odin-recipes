    <p>What are taters doing in a taco, you ask? <em>Everything, we say!</em> Crispy, roasted 
        potatoes and zucchini are the perfect way to make taco night meatless. Load those deliciously spiced
        veggies into steamy flour tortillas, then enlist the help of some seriously satisfying toppings
        bring it home: tangy pico de gallo, vegan crema, and <strong>hot sauce.</strong>
