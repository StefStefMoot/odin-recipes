Recipes for all my fellows

This is my first project and I am creating a basic website to host some of the recipes I've learned. But more than that, it's to ensure that I know the basics of making a website and using HTML. I will have a site with headings, text (lists too!), links and images. Who knows, I might be able to sneak a gif in there as well.
